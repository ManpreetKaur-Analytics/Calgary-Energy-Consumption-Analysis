# 🔍 Calgary Corporate Energy Consumption Analysis (2014-2024)  

## 📝 Project Description  
This project analyzes a decade of energy consumption data from municipal facilities across Calgary, Alberta. Using **SQL** for end-to-end data processing, the project transforms raw public data into actionable insights to help optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and improve sustainability efforts.  

---

## ✨ Key Features  
🔧 **Data Pipeline Development**: Built a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to clean and prepare public datasets  
📊 **Comprehensive Analysis**: Identified top energy-consuming facilities, seasonal trends, and departmental usage patterns  
💡 **Actionable Insights**: Pinpointed opportunities for cost savings through targeted efficiency improvements  

---

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation  
The project leverages **MySQL** for:  
✔️ **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, standardized units  
🔄 **Transformations**: Converted GJ→kWh, created time-based categories  
📈 **Advanced Analytics**: Aggregation, filtering, and trend analysis across 10+ years 
🧩 Advanced SQL: Stored Procedures-Implemented modular stored procedures to automate recurring analyses

---

## 📌 Business Impact  
The analysis revealed:  
🏭 **Top 5 facilities** = 32% of total energy consumption  
❄️ **Winter months** = 2.1× higher usage than summer  
🏗️ **Public Works** = 41% of total energy across departments  

---

## 🔄 Reproducibility & Transparency  
All SQL scripts and methodology are documented for:  
🔁 Easy replication by other analysts  
📤 Future expansion with additional datasets  
📊 Integration with visualization tools (Tableau/Power BI)  

---

## 🚀 Future Applications  
This work serves as a foundation for:  
🤖 Predictive modeling of energy demand  
📉 Automated reporting dashboards  
🌱 Policy decisions on sustainability initiatives
